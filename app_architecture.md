### 6. Storage Layer

**Document Storage**
- **Technology**: AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage
- **Purpose**: Store generated reports and research artifacts

**Database Backups**
- Regular automated backups
- Point-in-time recovery options

## Data Flow

1. **Research Initiation**:
   - User inputs research topic and preferences
   - System authenticates request and creates research job

2. **Research Execution**:
   - Backend orchestrates the research process
   - LLM generates research plan
   - Data collection services gather relevant information
   - LLM analyzes collected data and generates insights

3. **Report Generation**:
   - Visualization engine creates charts and graphs
   - PDF generation service compiles the final report
   - Report is stored in cloud storage

4. **Delivery**:
   - User is notified of completed research
   - Report is made available for viewing and download

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - OAuth 2.0 integration for third-party login

2. **Data Protection**:
   - Encryption at rest and in transit
   - PII handling according to regulations
   - API key rotation and secure storage

3. **API Security**:
   - Rate limiting
   - Input validation
   - CORS configuration

## Scalability Considerations

1. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - Containerized microservices architecture
   - Auto-scaling based on demand

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Caching frequently accessed data
   - Optimizing LLM prompt design for efficiency
   - Implementing parallel processing where possible

3. **Cost Management**:
   - Implementing tiered usage plans
   - Optimizing API calls to external services
   - Caching search results and API responses

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Centralized logging with ELK stack or CloudWatch
   - Performance metrics tracking
   - Error tracking and alerting

2. **Continuous Integration/Deployment**:
   - Automated testing pipeline
   - Blue/green deployment strategy
   - Feature flagging for gradual rollouts
